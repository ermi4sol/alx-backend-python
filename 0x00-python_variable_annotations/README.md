# Python Variable Annotations

This project focuses on using variable annotations in Python, particularly type hints introduced in Python 3. It contains various functions demonstrating type annotations, including function signatures, return types, and variable definitions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

- Type annotations in Python 3.
- How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
- Duck typing and its implications in Python.
- How to validate your code using MyPy.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `0-add.py`: Function to add two float values.
- `1-concat.py`: Function to concatenate two strings.
- `2-floor.py`: Function to return the floor of a float.
- `3-to_str.py`: Function to convert a float to its string representation.
- `4-define_variables.py`: Variables annotated with their types.
- `5-sum_list.py`: Function to sum a list of floats.
- `6-sum_mixed_list.py`: Function to sum a mixed list of integers and floats.
- `7-to_kv.py`: Function to return a tuple with a string and the square of a number.
- `8-make_multiplier.py`: Function to create a multiplier function.
- `9-element_length.py`: Function to return the length of each element in a list.

## Requirements

- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- Each file must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Code must adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All modules, classes, and functions must have appropriate documentation.
- The project includes type hints for all functions.

## Usage

To run the example files:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alx-backend-python.git
   cd alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations
